= Service Capability Contract: add
:toc:

== Document Version
1.0

== Intent
The intent of this document is to provide a contract for consumer reference on use of this capability

== Name
add

== Description
This capability provides functionality to add resources to the document root of this service. This is a STROMA compliant capability. If no alternative input is specified, the STROMA "data" will be used as the target resource contents, which will be either JSON or XML

== State Management
This service capability is stateless

== Owner
TBD

== Interface

=== Interface Classification
* STROMA
* synchronous
* HTTP

=== Expected Input

.Special URI rules

* The URI of the service request is utilized as the target resource location unless the *uri* parameter is specified. If brokered, only the *uri* parameter will be utilized.

.Parameters

* *uri* [optional when called directly] If specified, this will be the path (relative to the document root of this service) where the resource will be written to. This field is mandatory if brokered.
* The request body (STROMA compliant data, XML or JSON) is assumed to be the resource payload unless one of the following is specified:
	** *payload* [optional] If specified, this will be used as the data to write to the resource, instead of the body (highest priority)
	** *source* [optional] URI (absolute file path or http request) If specified, the contents of the resource written will be copied from this location

.Meta Data

N/A

[NOTE]
The following are trivial examples to use as a reference. Please see STROMA/X-STROMA specification for details.

==== XML request variations
----
http://localhost:8080/cyclades/restfs/dir-one/dir-two/sample.txt?action=add&data-type=xml&payload=sample%20payload
----

==== JSON request variations
----
http://localhost:8080/cycladesengine/restfs/dir-one/dir-two/sample.txt?action=add&data-type=json&payload=sample%20payload
----

=== Expected Output

You can see in the output below that the entity containts the following fields:

* *status-code* corresponds to the HTTP status code
* *message* is either the resource engaged or an error message

[NOTE]
If the "raw-response" STROMA parameter is utilized, the HTTP response code of this request will be automatically set to the status-code field mentioned above

==== XML
----
<response service="restfs" action="add" error-code="0">
<entity status-code="200" message="dir-one/dir-two/sample.txt"/>
</response>
----

==== JSON
----
{"error-code":"0","service":"restfs","action":"add","data":{"root":{"entity":{"@status-code":"200","@message":"dir-one\/dir-two\/sample.txt"}}}}
----

== Additional Orchestration Capability Details

None

== Functional Requirements

* The capability will enable users to add resources to this service's document root. This capability is STROMA compliant.

== Non Functional Requirements

* SLA/QoS
 - N/A

* Security
 - N/A
